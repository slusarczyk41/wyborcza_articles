# theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERibwqs9p38 stanford lectures about NLP

# algorithms: 
# SG - Skip grams (predit context based on word)
# CBOW - Countinous bag of words (predict word based on context)

# I will use it to create vectors (or use SVD or GloVe)
# Do pca to draw a graph
# Pick a few words for each emotion
# Mark them on chart and pick surrouding words
# The more close it is the bigger weight has

# And then I have more emotionaly sensed words for classification 
# from which I can label each comment
# And train model to classify comment based on TF*ITF

# practice:
